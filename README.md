# pastaroids
a game of asteroids, but made with pasta and processing

the processing version requires the Controlp5 library to be installed:
https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/

compiled binaries are avilable for various platforms under releases.
it runs fullscreen - so press your "esc" escape key to quit!

Windows, Linux & MacOS (apple silicon) users may need to install OpenJDK v 17.

MacOS versions will complain about notarisation:

this project was made in dialogue with an LLM in a couple of hours

feel free to clone and modify and make it more pastaesque
fusilli, orecchiette, farfalle welcome (thanks DrB!)

consume at your own risk.
