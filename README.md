# pastaroids
a game of asteroids, but made with pasta and processing

the processing version requires the Controlp5 library to be installed:
https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/

compiled binaries are avilable for various platforms under releases.
it runs fullscreen - so press your "esc" escape key to quit!

Windows, Linux & MacOS (apple silicon) users may need to install OpenJDK v 17.
https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=17

MacOS versions will complain about notarisation:

this project was made in dialogue with an LLM in a couple of hours

feel free to clone and modify and make it more pastaesque

if you're using an AI to code:

simply open the source files in processing: https://processing.org

copy and past the source code into your llm prompt window and tell it what you want (e.g. more variation in pasteroid shapes), or add a controller of some sort using Controlp5 to modify the shape using some algorithm (e.g. parameter/noise/sin/cos etc.) - have a discussion!

describe what you are doing and what you want it to do and how - for example "this is a processing project I want to modify, making the asteroid shapes more like pasta. Tell me step by step how I might do this and give me commented code to work with."

This is called chain-of-thought reasoning and will assist both you and the AI in converging upon your goal.

iterate your prompts (keep a record in a text doc) and cutnpaste into processing to see if it runs

you will need to have some understanding of coding to make sense of the process - get up to speed with youtube videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrC-HcVNfULZoKXd2PRi1Mcl3IhGrBiLk&si=1_flFPgMLvOYj1Yh
